# Mastermind

Deployed on: https://hpufo.github.io/Mastermind

My implementation of the board game Mastermind using React and SCSS.

How to play: The game picks four unique numbers range 0-9, you have ten turns to guess the number. The game will respond with red circles to indicate that you have a correct number in the right position, and white circles means that you have a correct number in the wrong position.
